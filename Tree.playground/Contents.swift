 Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
 
 For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

 Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).
 
 For example:
 Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

 / \
 9  20
 /  \
 15   7
 return its level order traversal as:
 [
